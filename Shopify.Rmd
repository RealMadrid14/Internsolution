### Q1
#### a.
```{r}
boxplot(Shopify$total_items)###Because of the outliers (total_items=2000, the AOV would be improved a lot. Thus, it would be going wrong) 
unique(Shopify$total_items)
Shopify_1 <- Shopify[Shopify$total_items != 2000,]###We need to delete the outlier(total_items=2000)
(AOV_NEW <- sum(Shopify_1$order_amount)/nrow(Shopify_1))
```

#### b.
## Metric1: Median order value
## Metric2: Use the sum of order amount by shop as the metric 

#### c.
```{r}
(Metric1 <- median(Shopify$order_amount))
library(dplyr)
Shopify_2 <- group_by(Shopify, shop_id)
Metric2 <- summarise(Shopify_2, order_amount_by_shop = sum(order_amount))
Metric2
```
